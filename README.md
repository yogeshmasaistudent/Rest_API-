# ⭐⭐⭐ Welcome to today’s REST API session.⭐⭐⭐

***

##  INTRODUCTION — 

> "Hi everyone, welcome to this session.  
> Today we will learn REST APIs in the clearest way possible.  
> We will build everything step-by-step, from complete basics to fully functional APIs using Node.js and MongoDB.  
> I will explain each method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) one at a time.  
> We will write theory → then code → then test it → then move to the next part.  
> By the end of this session, you will be able to build this entire backend by yourself."

***

## 🧠 STEP 1 — Understanding Backend 

> "Before writing any code, I want you to understand what backend actually means.  
> Backend is the brain of an application.  
> Front-end is what we see, backend is what works behind the scenes.
> 
> **Examples:**  
> - Opening Instagram feed → backend sends data  
> - Creating a new account → backend stores data  
> - Editing profile → backend updates data  
> - Deleting a post → backend removes data  
> 
> So backend handles **Read, Create, Update, Delete**, which directly map to:
> - **GET** (Read)
> - **POST** (Create)
> - **PUT/PATCH** (Update)
> - **DELETE** (Remove)"

***

## 🧠 STEP 2 — What is a REST API? 

> "REST API is simply a way for frontend and backend to talk to each other.  
> It uses specific methods to tell the server what we want to do.  
> Let me explain these 5 methods very simply:"

| Method | Meaning         | Real Life Example          |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| GET    | Read data      | View Instagram feed       |
| POST   | Add new data   | Create new account        |
| PUT    | Replace full data | Edit full profile     |
| PATCH  | Update partial data | Change only username |
| DELETE | Remove         | Delete a post             |

> "We will write all of these today,  
> but one-by-one, so everything becomes crystal clear."

## 🏗️ STEP 3 — Project Folder Structure 

> "Before writing APIs, we must set up our backend project properly.  
> Professional developers never put everything in one file.  
> **We will follow this clean structure:**"

```
rest-demo/
│
├── config/        → MongoDB connection  
├── models/        → Mongoose schema  
├── routes/        → REST API routes  
└── index.js       → Entry point  
```

> "This structure keeps code clean and understandable for beginners."

***

## 🟦 STEP 4 — Creating the Entry Point (`index.js`)

> "Let's start from the most basic file — our entry point.  
> Just like index.html is the starting point for frontend,  
> index.js is the starting point for backend."

**Create `index.js`:**

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Server is working...");
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 8080");
});
```

> "Now let's run this command:"
> 
> ```
> node index.js
> ```
> 
> "Open browser → [http://localhost:8080]()  
> If you see 'Server is working…', then our setup is correct."

***

## 🟦 STEP 5 — Connecting MongoDB (`config/db.js`)

> "Now we need to connect to MongoDB.  
> We will keep the connection logic in a separate file inside the config folder."

**Create: `config/db.js`**

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const connectDB = () => {
  return mongoose.connect("mongodb+srv://kushawahyogesh93:Yogesh@cluster0.j9tkecq.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0");
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

> "That's it. Very simple."

***

## 🟦 STEP 6 — Creating Our Model (`models/student.model.js`)

> "Now we create a model.  
> A model is like a structure or a form—  
> it tells MongoDB what fields each student will have."

**Create: `models/student.model.js`**

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  city: String
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Student", studentSchema);
```

***

## 🟦 STEP 7 — Creating Route File (Starting Empty)

> "Now we create a route file where all REST API methods will go.  
> But remember—we will add them one by one."

**Create: `routes/student.routes.js`**

```js
const express = require("express");
const Student = require("../models/student.model");
const router = express.Router();

module.exports = router;
```

***

# ⭐⭐⭐ NOW OUR MAIN PART BEGINS ⭐⭐⭐

## ⭐ STEP 8 — Understanding and Coding Each REST Method One-by-One

> We will now learn each method in perfect order:  
> 1️⃣ **GET**  
> 2️⃣ **POST**  
> 3️⃣ **PUT**  
> 4️⃣ **PATCH**  
> 5️⃣ **DELETE**

***

### 🟦 METHOD 1 — GET (Read Data)

> "GET is used to read data from the server.  
> GET never changes the database.  
> It is the most commonly used method."  
> Real-life example:  
> "Viewing Instagram feed."

**🧑‍💻 NOW WRITE THE GET CODE**  
Update `routes/student.routes.js`:

```js
// GET - Read all students
router.get("/students", async (req, res) => {
  const data = await Student.find();
  res.send(data);
});
```

**🧪 TEST GET REQUEST**  
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/students
```
> "Great! GET method is working."

***

### 🟩 METHOD 2 — POST (Create Data)

> "POST is used to create new data.  
> If a new user signs up or a new student is added — that is POST."

**🧑‍💻 NOW WRITE POST CODE**

```js
// POST - Create a student
router.post("/students", async (req, res) => {
  const student = new Student(req.body);
  await student.save();
  res.send("Student created");
});
```

**🧪 TEST POST REQUEST**  
```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/students
```
Send JSON body:
```json
{
  "name": "Yogesh",
  "age": 22,
  "city": "Indore"
}
```

> "Now open GET again —  
> you will see the new student added."

***

### 🟧 METHOD 3 — PUT (Full Replace)

> "PUT is used for full update.  
> It replaces the entire record with new data."  
> Real-life example:  
> "Updating your entire profile."

**🧑‍💻 NOW WRITE PUT CODE**

```js
// PUT - Full replace
router.put("/students/:id", async (req, res) => {
  await Student.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { overwrite: true });
  res.send("Student fully replaced");
});
```

**🧪 TEST PUT REQUEST**  
```
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/students/<id>
```
> "PUT will replace everything."

***

### 🟨 METHOD 4 — PATCH (Partial Update)

> "PATCH updates only the fields you send.  
> PATCH does NOT replace the whole document."  
> Real-life example:  
> "Updating only your city or username."

**🧑‍💻 NOW WRITE PATCH CODE**

```js
// PATCH - Partial update
router.patch("/students/:id", async (req, res) => {
  await Student.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body);
  res.send("Student partially updated");
});
```

**🧪 TEST PATCH**  
```
PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/students/<id>
```

***

### 🟥 METHOD 5 — DELETE (Remove Data)

> "DELETE is used to remove a record."  
> Example:  
> "Deleting an Instagram post."

**🧑‍💻 NOW WRITE DELETE CODE**

```js
// DELETE - Remove student
router.delete("/students/:id", async (req, res) => {
  await Student.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
  res.send("Student deleted");
});
```

**🧪 TEST DELETE**  
```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/students/<id>
```

***

## 🏆 FINAL ROUTES FILE (After Completing All Methods)
```js
const express = require("express");
const Student = require("../models/student.model");
const router = express.Router();

// GET
router.get("/students", async (req, res) => {
  const data = await Student.find();
  res.send(data);
});

// POST
router.post("/students", async (req, res) => {
  const student = new Student(req.body);
  await student.save();
  res.send("Student created");
});

// PUT
router.put("/students/:id", async (req, res) => {
  await Student.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { overwrite: true });
  res.send("Student fully replaced");
});

// PATCH
router.patch("/students/:id", async (req, res) => {
  await Student.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body);
  res.send("Student partially updated");
});

// DELETE
router.delete("/students/:id", async (req, res) => {
  await Student.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
  res.send("Student deleted");
});

module.exports = router;
```

***

## 🟦 FINAL STEP — Update `index.js` to use DB + Routes

```js
const express = require("express");
const connectDB = require("./config/db");
const studentRoutes = require("./routes/student.routes");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Connect DB
connectDB().then(() => console.log("DB connected"));

// Use Routes
app.use("/api", studentRoutes);

// Root Route
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("API is working...");
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log("Server started on 8080");
});
```
